TODO
====

- textures
  - assets or url
  - different bit formats (8888, 4444)
  - load textures asynchronously and use callback to indicate that the data can be uploaded to gpu

- Render texture

- verify blending (transparency)

- remove all singletons?
  - use "current" director
- modify opengl context
  - control over depth/stencil
  - render target


- Check handling of global uniforms at F4
- Render loop
- Scene and Node
  - scene graph
- Primitives
  - plane
  - sphere
- handle multiple contexts
  - all objects created with a contextId ?
  - render targets
- render order : group by geometries
  - group by materials?

- Material implementation
  - texture material
  - color material
- View
- html5 development env to automatically build and re-deploy on server

DONE
====

x Intellij
x Use Float32Array and Matrix3D for KFUniform data
x Uniform: set value in GPU
x Global uniforms
x use haxe properties
x Event emitter
x Camera
x   Camera properties
x Geometry
x   VertexAttribute buffers
x StateManager
x MeshNode (Geometry and Material)
x update camera matrices if not added to the scene
x attribute state manager
x pass state managers to vertex data (remove singleton)
x get OpenGL doc offline
x custom attributes
x interleaved data
x store vertex attribute size, type (GL.Float, etc) in VertexData rather than separate maps
x handle ubyte color arrays
x update haxe, openfl, lime
x Int32Array indexes not working?
x verify/set float precisions in shaders
x textures
x   use state/texture manager for binding textures
x   don't create GLTexture immediately : wait until 'update' render phase
x   texture uniforms
x     automatically bind texture on material update
x   texture units ?
x     manual or automatic ?
x   unbind texture when deleted
x   non-pow2 images
x     need to modify UVs ?
x     three.js offsetRepeat uniform to dynamically scale/translate UVs
x   load from png
x   load from jpg
x handle "prepareForUse" in program uniforms
