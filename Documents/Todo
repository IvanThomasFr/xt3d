TODO
====

- get OpenGL doc offline
- Int32Array indexes not working?
- verify/set float precisions in shaders
- store vertex attribute size, type (GL.Float, etc) in VertexData rather than separate maps
- handle "prepareForUse" in program uniforms
- pass state managers to vertex data (remove singleton)
- handle ubyte color arrays
- Check handling of global uniforms at F4
- Render loop
- Scene and Node
  - scene graph
- Primitives
  - plane
  - sphere
   - interlaced data
- handle multiple contexts
  - all objects created with a contextId ?
  - render targets
- render order : group by geometries
  - group by materials?

- Material implementation
- View
- attribute state manager


DONE
====

x Intellij
x Use Float32Array and Matrix3D for KFUniform data
x Uniform: set value in GPU
x Global uniforms
x use haxe properties
x Event emitter
x Camera
x   Camera properties
x Geometry
x   VertexAttribute buffers
x StateManager
x MeshNode (Geometry and Material)
x update camera matrices if not added to the scene
